# Automated-Billing-System-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Image-Processesing

The Automated Grocery Billing System leverages machine learning and computer vision to recognize grocery items and generate a bill based on detected products. This project uses a YOLOv5 model to identify grocery items in real-time and automates the billing process by tallying quantities and prices. It is designed to streamline checkout processes and improve efficiency in retail environments.

Features:
1. Real-time Item Recognition: Identifies multiple grocery items in images using a trained YOLOv5 model.
2. Automated Billing: Counts detected items and generates a total bill.
3. CSV Export: Saves bill details, including item names, quantities, and prices, as a CSV file for record-keeping.


Technologies Used:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Machine Learning Framework: YOLOv5 (PyTorch)
3. Data Annotation Tool: Roboflow for labeling images
4. Libraries: OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy
